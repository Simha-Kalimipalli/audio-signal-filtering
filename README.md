# audio-signal-filtering


In this project, we used various techniques to create low-pass filters to reduce noise in three sounds, a) birds chirping b) drums being played c) a human voice. Once we had cleaned the audio, our main tasks were to 1)  Find the silent regions in the Bird audio file, 2)Find the number of beats per minute in the Drum sample, 3) Find the number of syllables in the human voice audio.  We used various Matlab sound processing functios to aide our work.
